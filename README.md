# SECRETUM

## The Story
Some years ago I got tired with remembering complex password to keep my accounts secure.
Obviously, I did not trust any of the proprietary password managers, while open source
projects seemed a bit outdated with respect to their technology stacks. This repository
started as a dump of source code I coded for myself over these years.

## The Goal
Secretum is a password manager with the following feature targets by the year of 2020:
* universal access from any major platform
* easily extendable modules for any private purpose
* cutting-edge encryption and bullet-proof security model
