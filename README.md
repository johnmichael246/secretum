## What's the story behind Secretum?
Some years ago I got tired with remembering complex password to keep my accounts secure.
Obviously, I did not trust any of the proprietary password managers, while open source
projects seemed a bit outdated with respect to their technology stacks. This repository
started as a dump of source code I coded for myself over these years and a vision of
a perfect password manager I could trust and enjoy interacting with.
